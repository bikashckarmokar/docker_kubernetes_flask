# will show available docker images
docker images

# for showing all the running processes or containers
docker ps -a

# to see only running containers
docker ps

# to build a docker image
docker build .

# build docker image with specific name
docker build --tag image_name .

# if python is not available in local machine it will download from dockerhub
docker run python

# iterative mode
docker run -it python


# running the image and expose to a specific port
# here p means publish
docker run -p 5000:5000 image_id_here_from_the_docker_build


# adding expose, this is optional. its enhance readability for user which port is used for exposing
EXPOSE port_num


# stop a container/service running in docker
docker stop container_id

# starting a container after stop it once. It must run once to restart using start
# docker start container_id

# for running or stopping any container to identify containers do not need to write whole name
# abrztu56ifg
# the bove can be writen as
docker run ab, also just docker a, if there are only one container starting with a


# optimization tips
# before copying all files separately copy requirement file and run pip install. so if no packages changed later
# and only source code changed then those layers will not run during docker build. As we know if any layer change then
# all the following layers will also run again during docker build. 



# docker attached and detached mode
# docker start -a container_id
# start is by default detach mode. so to attach have to use -a
# If you started a container in detached mode (i.e. with -d), you can still attach to it afterwards without 
# restarting the Container with the following command:
# docker attach container_id

# logs
# if i run a container in detach mode and want to see the prints then i can use 
# docker logs container_id
# this will show all the prints
# also i can use -f to follow the future prints 
# docker logs -f container_id

# interactive mode
# -i and -t will help to run a interactive python console app from docker 
# -t allcates a pseudo tty
# -t -i can be written as -it also
# docker start -a will not work perfectly for giving input
# docker -a -i will solve the problem. -a -i or -ai 
# in this case docker will just run once and done. docker ps will not show running container for -ai mode in this example

# remove container
# can not remove running container
# if an image has container created from it then that image can not be deleted

#  To remove all unused images:
# docker image prune

# To remove all stopped container:
# docker container prune

# Remove container automaticall after exit
# docker run --rm --p container_id

# To learn more about the created image
# docker image inspect image_id/image_name


# copy
